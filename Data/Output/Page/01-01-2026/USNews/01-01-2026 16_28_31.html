A money market account<b> </b>is a banking instrument. A money market fund is an investment product. Money market funds are a type of <a href="https://money.usnews.com/funds/mutual-funds">mutual fund</a> that invests in cash and cash-equivalent securities.</p></div><div class="Raw-slyvem-0 jDbFwb"><p>Money market accounts may include "savings" or "deposit" in their name in an effort to relieve confusion and to help clarify that the account is not an investment fund. </p></div><div class="Raw-slyvem-0 jDbFwb"><p>Read more about other types of accounts similar to <a href="https://www.usnews.com/banking/articles/what-is-a-money-market-account-and-how-does-it-work">money market accounts</a>, like <a href="https://www.usnews.com/banking/articles/what-is-a-certificate-of-deposit">certificates of deposit</a>.</p></div><div class="Raw-slyvem-0 jDbFwb"><h2><label data-toc-text="How Does a Money Market Account Work?" id="how-does-it-work">How Does a Money Market Account Work?</label></h2></div><div class="Raw-slyvem-0 jDbFwb"><p>An MMA is primarily a savings vehicle. After you open this type of account, you normally can make unlimited additional deposits. Many banks and credit unions make deposits easy by allowing transfers from other accounts or remote check deposits with a mobile phone app as well as in person in a branch or by U.S. mail or phone.</p></div><div class="Raw-slyvem-0 jDbFwb"><h2>Rates</h2></div><div class="Raw-slyvem-0 jDbFwb"><p>While MMAs tend to offer higher rates than standard savings or checking accounts, rates vary from one institution to another. Rates for MMAs, CDs and high-yield savings accounts tend to fluctuate within a narrow range of one another. A high-yield savings account is one that pays a higher rate with a higher minimum balance. If you don't need the flexibility of an MMA, you might get a higher rate with a CD or high-yield savings account. It's smart to shop around for an account that fits your needs.</p></div><div class="Raw-slyvem-0 jDbFwb"><h2>Withdrawals </h2></div><div class="Raw-slyvem-0 jDbFwb"><p>Some banks and credit unions limit the number of monthly transfers or withdrawals you can make from your MMA, often capping those transactions at six per month. These restrictions used to be required by federal law, although the rule was lifted in 2020. However, many banks still maintain those caps.</p></div><div class="Raw-slyvem-0 jDbFwb"><p>Transactions that banks may limit can include transfers to another account, payment by check or debit card and automated payments.</p></div><div class="Raw-slyvem-0 jDbFwb"><p>What typically doesn't count toward the six-per-month limit: withdrawals by ATM, in person, mail, messenger or by telephone with a check mailed to the depositor.</p></div><div class="Raw-slyvem-0 jDbFwb"><p>If your number of withdrawals or transfers violates the account rules, your bank or credit union could charge you a fee; prevent you from making any more limited transactions; or close your account and deposit your funds in a checking account, which may not earn interest. Read the disclosures when you open the account to find out what the rules are. If you're confused, call your institution and ask for clarification.</p></div><div class="Raw-slyvem-0 jDbFwb"><h2>Fees and Minimum Account Balances </h2></div><div class="Raw-slyvem-0 jDbFwb"><p>Minimum balance requirements for MMAs vary. Minimums of $100 to $10,000 are common, but some MMAs have no minimum balance requirement. </p></div><div class="Raw-slyvem-0 jDbFwb"><p>Many banks won't charge any fees for an MMA as long as you maintain a minimum balance and don't exceed the monthly limit on the specified transactions mentioned above. </p></div><div class="Raw-slyvem-0 jDbFwb"><p>To avoid paying these fees, shop around and compare accounts before you open one and plan your withdrawals carefully so you don't violate the six-per-month rule. If you're not sure how the rule applies to a specific transfer or withdrawal from your account, call your institution and ask before you make the transaction.</p></div><div class="Raw-slyvem-0 jDbFwb"><h2><label data-toc-text="Pros and Cons of Money Market Accounts" id="pros-and-cons-of-money-market-accounts">Pros and Cons of Money Market Accounts</label></h2></div><div class="Raw-slyvem-0 jDbFwb"><p></p></div><div style="clear:both"></div><react-trigger trigger="view"><div><p class="Heading-sc-1w5xk2o-0 jZSPVX">Pros</p><ul class="IconList__List-emyavm-1 lmqHzh"><li spacing="4" class="IconList__ListItem-emyavm-2 bJPNtK"><svg role="img" fill="#06844B" width="1.5rem" height="1.5rem" class="Icon-sc-9wq8ul-0 IconList__Iconography-emyavm-0 fuNHPY bMqEdY"><use xlink:href="#check-pro" filter="0"></use></svg><div class="IconList__TextContainer-emyavm-3 jgkucL"><p class="Paragraph-sc-1iyax29-0 IconList__ParagraphReversed-emyavm-4 gAEpb IconList__Headline-emyavm-5">MMAs allow you to earn interest on your savings, and the annual percentage yield for MMAs is generally higher than for a standard savings account.</p></div></li><li spacing="4" class="IconList__ListItem-emyavm-2 bJPNtK"><svg role="img" fill="#06844B" width="1.5rem" height="1.5rem" class="Icon-sc-9wq8ul-0 IconList__Iconography-emyavm-0 fuNHPY bMqEdY"><use xlink:href="#check-pro" filter="0"></use></svg><div class="IconList__TextContainer-emyavm-3 jgkucL"><p class="Paragraph-sc-1iyax29-0 IconList__ParagraphReversed-emyavm-4 gAEpb IconList__Headline-emyavm-5">MMAs do not have term limits, so you can withdraw your money at any time, within your monthly limits.</p></div></li><li spacing="4" class="IconList__ListItem-emyavm-2 bJPNtK"><svg role="img" fill="#06844B" width="1.5rem" height="1.5rem" class="Icon-sc-9wq8ul-0 IconList__Iconography-emyavm-0 fuNHPY bMqEdY"><use xlink:href="#check-pro" filter="0"></use></svg><div class="IconList__TextContainer-emyavm-3 jgkucL"><p class="Paragraph-sc-1iyax29-0 IconList__ParagraphReversed-emyavm-4 gAEpb IconList__Headline-emyavm-5">Most MMAs allow you to make an unlimited number of deposits, which can be done through branches, transfers or online or mobile banking.</p></div></li><li spacing="4" class="IconList__ListItem-emyavm-2 bJPNtK"><svg role="img" fill="#06844B" width="1.5rem" height="1.5rem" class="Icon-sc-9wq8ul-0 IconList__Iconography-emyavm-0 fuNHPY bMqEdY"><use xlink:href="#check-pro" filter="0"></use></svg><div class="IconList__TextContainer-emyavm-3 jgkucL"><p class="Paragraph-sc-1iyax29-0 IconList__ParagraphReversed-emyavm-4 gAEpb IconList__Headline-emyavm-5">In an MMA, your money is backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. or the National Credit Union Administration.</p></div></li></ul><p class="Heading-sc-1w5xk2o-0 jZSPVX">Cons</p><ul class="IconList__List-emyavm-1 lmqHzh"><li spacing="4" class="IconList__ListItem-emyavm-2 bJPNtK"><svg role="img" fill="#B92523" width="1.5rem" height="1.5rem" class="Icon-sc-9wq8ul-0 IconList__Iconography-emyavm-0 fuNHPY bMqEdY"><use xlink:href="#minus" filter="0"></use></svg><div class="IconList__TextContainer-emyavm-3 jgkucL"><p class="Paragraph-sc-1iyax29-0 IconList__ParagraphReversed-emyavm-4 gAEpb IconList__Headline-emyavm-5">Although federal Regulation D is suspended, many banks still limit the number of withdrawals or transfers for MMAs monthly.</p></div></li><li spacing="4" class="IconList__ListItem-emyavm-2 bJPNtK"><svg role="img" fill="#B92523" width="1.5rem" height="1.5rem" class="Icon-sc-9wq8ul-0 IconList__Iconography-emyavm-0 fuNHPY bMqEdY"><use xlink:href="#minus" filter="0"></use></svg><div class="IconList__TextContainer-emyavm-3 jgkucL"><p class="Paragraph-sc-1iyax29-0 IconList__ParagraphReversed-emyavm-4 gAEpb IconList__Headline-emyavm-5">Most MMAs have monthly maintenance fees, but these can sometimes be waived by maintaining minimum balances.</p></div></li></ul></div></react-trigger><div class="Raw-slyvem-0 jDbFwb"><p></p></div><div class="Raw-slyvem-0 jDbFwb"><h2><label data-toc-text="How to Choose a Money Market Account" id="how-to-choose-a-money-market-account">How to Choose a Money Market Account</label></h2></div><div class="Raw-slyvem-0 jDbFwb"><p>There are a number of factors that you should consider when choosing a money market account.

That means MMA deposits lose purchasing power over time as market prices rise. </p></div><div class="Raw-slyvem-0 jDbFwb"><p>"The biggest negative of these accounts is that they typically don't offer a high enough interest rate to keep up with inflation, so you are losing purchasing power," Mackenzie says.</p></div><div class="Raw-slyvem-0 jDbFwb"><p>The trade-off between investment risk and inflation risk can make saving for a home, car or college difficult.

CDs tend to offer slightly better rates than savings accounts or MMAs, particularly if the CD has a lengthy term. However, that's not always the case. Some high-yield savings accounts, which typically require a minimum balance, offer rates comparable to MMAs or even CDs.</p></div><div class="Raw-slyvem-0 jDbFwb"><p>Of the three accounts, only MMAs offer checks or a debit card for easy withdrawals. However, a savings account linked to a checking account could make your funds almost as easy to access as an MMA.
